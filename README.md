## Usage

To use this work guide, we can review the notes of each section and thus see a list of the topics that we have seen from the prework. In this prework, we have learned many languages such as HTML, which is the standard language for creating and designing web pages.
CSS is a styling language that is used to control the visual appearance and presentation of a web page and we also have JavaScript which is a high-level programming language that is mainly used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. If you want to start in the world of full-stack programming we can start by learning HTML because it is what makes all other languages connect and create a correct page.
